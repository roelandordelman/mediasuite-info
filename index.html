          <p>TWhat is the Media Suite?
    The CLARIAH Media Suite is a (re)search environment created as part of the larger CLARIAH project, Media Studies focus. It offers a group of specialized services for media scholars (and other scholars who make intensive use of audio-visual media) to enable them to conduct data-driven research. This environment has been built based on a series of digital humanities tools developed in prior projects, such as AVResearcherXL, Comerda, DIVE, Oral History Today (OHT) and TROVE. It aims to make these tools sustainable.
    
    How can I access the Media Suite?
    To access the MediaSuite services (from May, 2017) you must have a valid university account in The Netherlands. You will be prompted to fill-in the details via an Identity Provider discovery service. For security and research purposes, we additionally request you to fill in a small questionnaire before accessing. NOTE: During April 2017 you will only be able to access the Media Suite through OneGini. In order to receive an invitation please follow the instructions on this document.
    
    How does the CLARIAH Media Suite work?
    The Media Suite is built based on a co-development approach based on the collaboration between scholars and software engineers. In its current version (See releases) is, and does not intend, to be a complete or finished product. The instruments built and offered in the Media Suite allows scholars to identify collection of interest, search, explore, select, visualize and analyze (annotate) these sources via pre-defined tools (see Recipes) or by building their own tools (see Components), by using their own work or user space. Read more our Knowledge Base.
    
    How has the Media Suite been built?
    A generic infrastructure is required to cater for the general needs of every user group. The infrastructure provided by the CLARIAH Media Suite incorporates flexible functionality capable of addressing very specialized research questions. Media scholars expressed their desire to use the collections and tools which were previously "locked" together in the individual prototypes. CLARIAH MS has been designed in a modular way (separating data and functionalities from the original tools) each module (or component) performs a single, well-defined task. Modules can interoperate to construct more sophisticated functionality when they are combined in "recipes".

    Where is the Media Suite hosted?
    Prototypes are currently hosted on a new infrastructure at the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) data centre (see the CLARIAH Lab). All tools and components developed within CLARIAH are open source, the Media Suite code is available in the GitHub repository.</p></div>

        <div><h1 class="anchor">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p>This page includes documentation of the CLARIAH Media Suite intended to facilitate its use by scholars (researchers) and curators (content/data providers). It has been created using Github pages (), and it is being constantly updated via the repository ().</p></div>
      <div class="child" id="docs-data">
        <div><h1 class="anchor">2. Data</h1>
          <p>For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite:
    -Open CKAN by using the "Visit CKAN" button at the end of this page. You will be redirected to an external service (http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/dataset), built using the CKAN registration software.
    -In that page, you can see the datasets that are registered in CKAN by the Media Studies focus of CLARIAH. 
    -You can search registered datasets by using tags (thematic, media types), organizations (creators of the datasets or collections), or groups (groups are used to organise datasets by data provider). Please be aware that these tags, organizations and groups refer to the "dataset level", not to the content itself.
    -If you want to search the content of the datasets, go to the "Tools" section of the Media Suite. You will find a "Collection selector" in each tool, which will give you the list of available/registered collections in CKAN that you can search or browse.
    -Registering your own datasets is not supported yet. Please Contact us if you have any questions.

    For curators/data owners:
    The current instance of CKAN implemented for the CLARIAH media studies focus includes datasets that we have registered (by harvesting or importing them) on behalf of the collection owners. In the near future, more organisations can register their collections and add data themselves. Registration with an open licence is possible, but private access is also an option. The data itself can be added to each registered collection using different formats (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF). Please Contact us if you are interested in providing/enabling access to Data in CLARIAH in general, or in the CLARIAH Media Suite specifically.

    Note: CLARIAH also offers other data registration services (see "Anansi" /link: https://www.clariah.nl/files/wp/wp2_anansi_project_brief.pdf ; https://vimeo.com/186090384), merging these services is work in progress.

          <p>For researchers/end users of the Data services of the CLARIAH Media Suite:
    -Select the tool of your choice (each tool helps you to perform different tasks).
    -Go to the "Details" button of each tools to learn about each specific tool. There you will also find a link to the "User manuals" of each tool.
    -Click on the "Open" button of the tool if you are ready to use it. </p></div>

      <div class="child" id="docs-tools-inspect-metadata">
        <div><h2 class="anchor">3.1. Inspect metadata</h2>
          <p>The purpose of this tool is to provide an overview of how a collection/dataset is constituted and also to allow a closer inspection of their metadata. It facilitates performing data analytics tasks on their metadata (e.g., detect incomplete data, observe value distributions along date fields), and sending the collection(s) to the other browsing and search recipes. It is important to have clear that the collection inspector does not give search results! For this purpose, the collections selected with this recipe have to be sent to the search recipes (step 5).</p>
